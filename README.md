# Collapsing Library for Spicetify

This is the first version of this extension that should make the Spotify Library easier to use. No longer do you have to navigate through folders, you can now just click on them to have them expand. Like the good old days.

# Known Issues

It looks the best with the library in compact mode, the list mode works as well but I have to add some settings to disable the left border.
It does not work wit the library in grid mode, but it doesn't break anything as far as I know.
